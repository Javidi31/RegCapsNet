# CapsNet Regularization and its Conjugation with ResNet
This is a [Keras](https://keras.io/) implementation of Regularized CapsNet with ResNet.
To know more about how this works, please refer to the [original paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320321000388)

Run "CapsNet.py" for the [basic CapsuleNetwork model](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6975-dynamic-routing-between-capsules.pdf).

Run "RegCapsNet.py" for the Regularized version of CapsuleNetwork model.

Run "mainResNet.py" to train ResNet-18 model 


Run "ExtractResNetFeatures.py" to extract ResNet features
